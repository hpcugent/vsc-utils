# Description
Common tools used within our organization.
These tools live in the vsc.utils namespace, toghether with the tools from
vsc-base.

They have been split of from vsc-base because the tools here need aditional dependencies
to work correctly whereas the tools in vsc-base do not.

Originally created by the HPC team of Ghent University (http://ugent.be/hpc).
